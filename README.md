### First things first let me introduce WHAT IS A README FILE. 

On GitHub is common to add a README.md file into every repository you make, in this document you should describe each part of the project. You may include a brief description of the porpuse of the development, about the creation, how do users can have access to such project as run and use, translations, describe what it is that your project makes easier, provide code examples.... it depends on you to explain what you consider necessary but make sure its clear and objective for whoever wants to run your code.

If you are a curious person and want to learn more about the README file here is a project very interesting to read -   ["Art of Readme - Learn the art of writing quality READMEs."](https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme#readme)  -  _Stephen Whitmore_. 

Those files have the extension md which stands for markdown. A markdown file is used for writing and it can support some html codes as branches of titles, divs and more. I suggest you to use the [Stackedit.io platform](https://stackedit.io/app#) to write your markdown files, it can be downloaded or used in your preferred browser online. 

If you are not familiarized with markdown, I highly recommend you read and consult the GitHub documentation  ["Basic writing and formatting syntax"](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) .

Now that you know about the usage of README files and its extension, you can define the README of your profile. Different from other apps, GitHub makes your profile management totally "codable" so you can shape it the way you prefer to, since its towards developers. Having a nice profile is very interesting, this way not only people have access to your codes, but also can connect and really see through the screen who had such idea. Besides nowadays, I've seen people using their github as a portfolio and if it's your case then you might want to have a nice approach to the users _kind of an UX talk isn't it?_ EXACTLY!. Well without further ado, in the next lines I'll give you some links and tips to make a nice front-end for your profile.

## :sparkles: README IDEAS :sparkles:

- Just as a tip, I advise you to use a real profile picture of your face, turns out to be more attractive and formal. 

- [GITHUB STATS CARD](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats): Displays a card with some information of your interaction as a user of github. Is a nice way to show your progress in the platform, you are able to custumize the card and shape it to your profile changing themes, colors and more. My favorite is the one that is a metric of which languages the readme's user has the most code on GitHub.

- [EMOJIS](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md#github-custom-emoji): A sympathetic and useful approach is using icons and emojis. Many profiles uses it, and turns out to be very cute.

 - [BADGES](https://dev.to/envoy_/150-badges-for-github-pnk): Now in terms of the technologies that you do deal with, feel free to search for badges, it works as a banner of your expertise. You also can add a badge to display your contact me bar as a LinkedIn badge.

 - [README TYPING SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.herokuapp.com/demo/): A fun way to custumize your profile is to add a kind of animation personalized with a message of your own, as an example it can be a title, a goodbye message, a banner showing your main languages as a dev.

All in all, GitHub profiles will always have their own way of expression and be as unic as the owner spent time on it. If you have some crazy idea don't fell shy, code it! And if you find a profile with something new which pleases the eyes, feel free to look over the coding details and try it on your profile, search for your doubts and I'm sure you will end up feeling rewarding. :sunglasses:
